                           TREEAREA + BUILDAREA do not need to sum up to 1.
        CLOCK     (float): the time axis for the potential fire in each
        NPARTTR     (int): total number of particles emitted from tree fire (0-10)
        NPARTBLD    (int): total number of particles emitted from building fire
        QMAXTR    (float): Maximum heat release (MW/m2) from trees in each cell
        QMAXBLD   (float): Maximum heat release (MW/m2) from buildings in each cell
        TIGNTR    (float): Ignition time delay for tree (since arrival of burning particle
                           in cell) for each cell (in s)
        TENDTR    (float): Fire duration for tree for each cell (s)
        TIGNBLD   (float): As for TIGNTR, but for the building
        TENDBLD   (float): As for TENDTR, but for the building
        BURNSTAT    (int): 0 in the beginning, will become 1 if visited by a burning particle.
        BURNPROG    (int): in the beginning, counts how many burning particles arrived
                           at this cell
        BURNSTAT2   (int): 1 if cell has all its particles, 0 when it has emptied them.

        Test numbers used for the above for now, more proper parameters and
        their dependence on wind & tree & building type to be used later.
        Other models for tree & building fire can be used, by adjusting NPART
        and their relation with QMAX and Q(t)
